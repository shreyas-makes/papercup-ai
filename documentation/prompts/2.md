Now, let's build the country selector and phone input components for the Papercup dialer. These are the first elements users will interact with before dialing.

1. Create a Stimulus controller for the country selector:
   - Implement a searchable dropdown with country flags and codes
   - Include a static list of common countries with their dial codes
   - Allow selecting a country which will update the phone input prefix

2. Build the phone number input field:
   - Create a text field that displays the selected country code
   - Implement formatting as the user types (spaces/dashes between number groups)
   - Add a clear button (Ã—) to empty the field

3. Style these components according to the specifications:
   - Container width: 320px
   - Heights: 48px for input/selector
   - Border: 1px solid #EEEEEE
   - Border-radius: 8px
   - Dropdown styling with flags, search input, scrollable area

4. Add basic validations for the phone number format using JavaScript:
   - Handle different country number formats
   - Show subtle validation indicators

All functionality should work with mock data and client-side only - we're not connecting to a backend yet. Use static country data (array of objects with country code, name, and flag).

Test thoroughly to ensure the country selection properly updates the dial code in the phone field, and that the dropdown search functions correctly.
