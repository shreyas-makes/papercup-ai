# A/B Testing Implementation

Let's implement A/B testing functionality for Papercup using the Speedrail boilerplate's testing framework. This will allow us to optimize the user experience and conversion rates by testing different designs and flows.

1. Configure the A/B testing framework:
   - Run the Speedrail A/B testing setup: `rails g speedrail:ab_testing:install`
   - Set up the required database tables:
     - Experiments
     - Variants
     - Participant assignments
     - Conversion events
   - Configure the test segment allocation algorithm
   - Implement visitor tracking using cookies and/or user IDs
   - Create the test management interface in the admin panel

2. Implement the testing JavaScript library:
   - Create Stimulus controller for A/B test assignment
   - Build variant rendering mechanism
   - Implement conversion tracking
   - Add debug mode for easy testing

3. Create pricing display tests:
   - Design multiple pricing presentations:
     - Standard 3-tier layout
     - "Most popular" highlighted variant
     - Simplified single-price variant
     - Feature-comparison table variant
   - Implement variant templates with shared styling
   - Set up conversion events:
     - "View pricing" 
     - "Select package"
     - "Complete purchase"
   - Configure results analysis dashboard

4. Implement onboarding flow tests:
   - Create alternative onboarding sequences:
     - Direct to dialer with tutorial overlay
     - Step-by-step wizard approach
     - Feature showcase then dialer
     - Video demonstration variant
   - Set up step tracking for each variant
   - Define conversion goals:
     - Complete onboarding
     - Make first call
     - Add credits
   - Create analytics dashboard for completion rates

5. Build UI element tests:
   - Design different call button variants:
     - Size variations
     - Color options
     - With/without text label
     - Different animations
   - Create alternative keypad layouts
   - Test different color schemes for the dialer
   - Measure engagement metrics:
     - Time to first interaction
     - Error rate
     - Completion time
     - User satisfaction

6. Connect test results to analytics:
   - Integrate with analytics framework
   - Track test cohorts long-term:
     - Retention differences
     - Lifetime value
     - Usage patterns
   - Create segment performance reports
   - Build user journey visualization by test variant

7. Implement automatic test optimization:
   - Set up multi-armed bandit algorithms
   - Configure automatic traffic allocation
   - Implement early stopping rules for clear winners/losers
   - Create continuous improvement workflow

8. Add A/B test monitoring:
   - Build real-time test performance dashboard
   - Create alert system for underperforming variants
   - Implement statistical significance calculator
   - Add export functionality for test results

Ensure all A/B tests are properly documented with clear hypotheses, expected outcomes, and success metrics. All tests should be designed to minimize user disruption while providing statistically significant results.

Make sure test variants maintain consistent functionality and only change the elements being tested. Implement proper error handling for all variants to ensure a good user experience regardless of the test group.

The A/B testing framework should scale to support multiple simultaneous experiments without interference, and should handle proper segmentation to ensure users have a consistent experience across visits.
