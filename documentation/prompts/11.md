Now, let's implement the call processing logic that will handle call initiation, status tracking, and billing. This is the core business logic of the application.

1. Create the calls controller:
   ```ruby
   rails generate controller Api::Calls create update show index
   ```

2. Implement call initiation endpoint:
   - Validate user has sufficient credits
   - Create new Call record with 'initiated' status
   - Trigger async job for call setup
   - Return call ID and initial state

3. Create CallService class:
   ```ruby
   # app/services/call_service.rb
   class CallService
     def initialize(call)
       @call = call
       @twilio_client = Twilio::REST::Client.new
     end

     def initiate
       # Call initiation logic
     end

     def update_status(status, duration = nil)
       # Status update logic
     end

     def terminate
       # Call termination logic
     end

     def calculate_cost(duration)
       # Cost calculation based on call duration and rate
     end
   end
   ```

4. Implement background jobs for call processing:
   ```ruby
   rails generate job InitiateCall
   rails generate job UpdateCallStatus
   rails generate job CallBilling
   rails generate job CallHangup
   ```

5. Create the call rate lookup service:
   - Implement prefix matching algorithm
   - Cache frequently used rates
   - Fall back to default rates if no match

6. Build the billing calculation logic:
   - Calculate costs based on duration and rate
   - Handle credit deduction
   - Create transaction records for billing

7. Implement call event tracking:
   - Create CallEvent model to track detailed events
   - Log key moments (initiated, ringing, answered, etc.)
   - Store metadata for analytics

8. Add error handling for call failures:
   - Network issues
   - Insufficient credits during call
   - Invalid destination numbers
   - Carrier failures

9. Create RSpec tests for all call processing logic:
   - Test cost calculations
   - Test credit deductions
   - Test call state transitions

The call processing logic should be robust and handle various edge cases like connection failures, insufficient credits during a call, and unexpected termination.
