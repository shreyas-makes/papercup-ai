Let's implement call quality monitoring and analytics to track system performance and user behavior.

1. Create call quality monitoring service:
   ```ruby
   # app/services/call_quality_service.rb
   class CallQualityService
     def self.track_metrics(call_id, metrics)
       # Store call quality metrics
     end

     def self.analyze_call(call)
       # Analyze call quality
     end
   end
   ```

2. Implement call event tracking system:
   - Track detailed events during call
   - Store WebRTC statistics
   - Monitor for drops and quality issues

3. Add browser-side quality monitoring:
   - Collect RTCPeerConnection statistics
   - Track jitter, packet loss, and latency
   - Report metrics to server periodically

4. Create an admin analytics dashboard:
   - Call volume by day/week/month
   - Revenue charts
   - Top destinations
   - Quality metrics overview

5. Implement user analytics for personal usage:
   - Show call history with quality indicators
   - Provide spending patterns
   - Display favorite destinations

6. Add fraud detection system:
   - Monitor for unusual calling patterns
   - Flag suspicious activities
   - Implement automatic protections

7. Create reporting system for key metrics:
   - Daily active users
   - Average call duration
   - Revenue per user
   - Conversion rates from free to paid

8. Build data export functionality:
   - CSV export of call history
   - PDF invoices/receipts
   - Analytics reports

This analytics system will provide insights into application usage and call quality, helping to identify issues and optimize the service. Ensure all data collection complies with privacy regulations and is properly anonymized where needed.
