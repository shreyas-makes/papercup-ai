Now, let's implement comprehensive frontend state management using Stimulus.js and create mock API responses to simulate backend functionality before we build it.

1. Create a main application Stimulus controller that will handle global state:
   - User authentication state
   - Credit balance
   - Current call status
   - UI state (showing warnings, modals, etc.)

2. Implement mock API services:
   - Create a `mockApi.js` file with simulated endpoints:
     - Authentication (login, logout)
     - Call operations (start, end)
     - Credit management (check balance, add credits)
     - Call history

3. Add realistic delays and response patterns:
   - 300-500ms delays to simulate network requests
   - Occasional random failures for testing error states
   - Persistent mock data using localStorage

4. Connect the existing components to use this state:
   - Update the keypad to check for sufficient balance before "calling"
   - Make the call history load from mock API
   - Have the active call screen update based on call state
   - Show low balance warning based on mock balance

5. Implement a debug panel (hidden in production):
   - Allow setting mock credit balance
   - Trigger different error conditions
   - Reset mock state

Test the entire frontend flow from start to finish:
1. User arrives at site
2. Selects country and enters number
3. "Signs in" with mock auth
4. Makes a "call" that shows connecting, then active
5. Ends call and sees updated history
6. Receives low balance warning after several calls
7. Adds mock credits

Ensure all UI components respond appropriately to state changes and that the user experience is seamless even with just frontend code.
