Let's implement the various error states and notification components that will be shown to users in different scenarios.

1. Create a Stimulus controller for notifications:
   - Handle showing/hiding different notification types
   - Implement dismiss functionality
   - Control notification timing (auto-dismiss for some types)

2. Build the low balance warning banner:
   - Persistent banner at the top
   - Yellow/orange background (#FFF3DC)
   - Message: "Your balance is low ($X.XX remaining)"
   - "Add Credits" button (yellow #FFD700)
   - Dismiss button (Ã—)
   - Slide-down animation (200ms ease-out)

3. Implement call failure notifications:
   - Modal/toast for various error types:
     - Network issues
     - Invalid number
     - Insufficient credits
     - Browser permission denied
   - Error-specific messages and icons
   - Different styling based on severity

4. Create loading state components:
   - Skeleton loader for dialer pad on initial load
   - Pulsing animation for connecting calls
   - Credit update indicator
   - Country selector loading state

5. Add toast notifications for successes:
   - Credits added
   - Call completed
   - Settings updated

Test all notifications by adding trigger buttons that simulate different scenarios. Ensure notifications are positioned correctly, display appropriate information, and can be dismissed properly.
