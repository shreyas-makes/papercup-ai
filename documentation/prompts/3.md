Now, let's enhance the existing keypad component by adding keyboard support. The keypad UI has already been implemented with a 3x4 grid layout and proper styling.

1. Add keyboard support to the existing Stimulus controller:
   - Implement keyboard event listeners for number keys (0-9)
   - Add support for special keys (*, #)
   - Connect keyboard input to the existing phone number field

2. Ensure keyboard input works seamlessly with the existing UI:
   - Maintain the same visual feedback as click events
   - Keep the same input validation and formatting
   - Preserve the connection with the country selector

3. Add visual feedback for keyboard input:
   - Use the same active state animation (scale: 0.95)
   - Maintain consistent styling with click events
   - Keep the same shadow and hover effects

4. Test the integration:
   - Verify keyboard input works with the phone input field
   - Ensure special keys (*, #) are handled correctly
   - Test the interaction with the country selector
   - Validate the formatting of entered numbers

The keypad UI is already implemented with proper styling and click handlers. This update focuses solely on adding keyboard support to enhance the user experience.
