Now, let's build the core keypad component for the dialer. This should be a traditional phone keypad layout that allows users to enter numbers either by clicking or using their keyboard.

1. Create a Stimulus controller for the keypad:
   - Implement click handlers for each button
   - Add keyboard support (number keys, *, #)
   - Connect keypad input to the phone number field from the previous step

2. Build the keypad UI with the following components:
   - 3x4 grid layout for buttons
   - Numbers 1-9, then *, 0, # in the bottom row
   - Letters under each number (like a traditional phone)
   - Each button styled as a circle with 64px diameter
   - 16px gaps between buttons

3. Style the keypad according to the specifications:
   - Button background: Light Gray (#F5F5F5)
   - Hover state: Slightly darker (#EEEEEE)
   - Active/Press state: Darker (#E0E0E0)
   - Numbers: 32px, 600 weight, black
   - Letters: 12px, 400 weight, medium gray
   - Border radius: 32px (fully rounded)

4. Add visual and audio feedback:
   - Subtle scale animation on press (transform: scale(0.95))
   - Optional: Add DTMF tone sounds when buttons are pressed

5. Create the main call button:
   - Green circular button (#4CAF50)
   - 64px diameter with white phone icon
   - Hover and active states
   - Positioned centered below the keypad

Ensure the keypad works seamlessly with the country selector and phone input from the previous step. When testing, clicking numbers should update the phone input field properly, and the keypad should handle both mouse and keyboard input.
