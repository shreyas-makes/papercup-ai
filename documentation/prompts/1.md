Create a new Rails 8 application for Papercup - a browser-based international calling platform. Set up the project with the following:

1. Initialize a new Rails 8 app with PostgreSQL database
2. Install and configure:
   - Stimulus.js for interactive components
   - Turbo for page transitions
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Work Sans font integration

3. Create a basic layout including:
   - A minimal top navigation bar (64px height, with placeholder for user balance, profile menu)
   - Main content area for the dialer
   - Footer with basic info

4. Implement basic routing:
   - Home route for the dialer (root path)
   - A placeholder for the credits page
   - Route for call history

Create the minimal viable structure needed to start building the dialer component. The focus is purely on structure - no real functionality yet.

Follow this color palette:
- Primary: Black (#000000)
- Secondary: White (#FFFFFF)
- Accent: Yellow (#FFD700)
- Call Button: Green (#4CAF50)
- Error/End Call: Red (#FF4444)
- Background: Light Gray (#F5F5F5)
- Text Secondary: Dark Gray (#333333)

Implement the Work Sans typography scale as defined in the specifications.
