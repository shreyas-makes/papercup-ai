Let's implement the call history section that will appear below the dialer. For now, we'll build this with mock data since we're still focusing on the frontend.

1. Create a Stimulus controller for the call history:
   - Load mock call history data (5-6 entries)
   - Implement sorting by date (most recent first)
   - Add functionality to redial a number when clicked

2. Build the call history UI:
   - Container matching dialer width (320px)
   - "Recent Calls" header (20px, 600 weight)
   - List of call entries with:
     - Phone number (16px, 500 weight)
     - Date/time of call (14px, 400 weight, #666666)
     - Call duration (14px, 400 weight, #666666)
     - Country flag icon if available

3. Style according to specifications:
   - Entry height: 72px
   - Padding: 16px
   - Border-bottom: 1px solid #F5F5F5
   - Hover state: Background #F9F9F9
   - Max entries visible: 5 (with possibility to view more)

4. Create mock data representing various call scenarios:
   - Successful calls of different durations
   - Calls to different countries
   - Missed or failed calls
   - Variation in timestamps (today, yesterday, past week)

5. Add empty state design:
   - Display when no call history exists
   - Simple message and illustration

The call history should look realistic but will use static data for now. When a user clicks on an entry, it should populate the dialer with that number (ready to call again). Test the responsiveness to ensure it works well on different screen sizes.
