Let's configure deployment for Papercup specifically on Hetzner infrastructure with Hatchbox orchestration.

1. Set up Hatchbox for Rails deployment:
   - Create a new Hatchbox app for Papercup
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure Ruby version (3.2+) and Rails environment
   - Add necessary buildpacks

2. Configure Hetzner Cloud infrastructure:
   - Provision app servers (CX31 or CX41 recommended)
   - Separate database server (CX41 with additional storage)
   - Dedicated servers for WebRTC media handling
   - Configure Hetzner Cloud Firewalls for each server type

3. Create Hatchbox deployment configuration:
   ```ruby
   # hatchbox.yml
   name: papercup
   servers:
     - name: web
       size: cx31
       count: 2
       region: hel1  # Helsinki region (or your preferred Hetzner region)
     - name: worker
       size: cx21
       count: 1
     - name: db
       size: cx41
       volume_size: 100 # GB
   
   env:
     RAILS_ENV: production
     RACK_ENV: production
     NODE_ENV: production
     RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: true
   ```

4. Set up WebRTC media servers on separate Hetzner instances:
   - Provision dedicated servers (AX41-NVMe or AX51-NVMe)
   - Install and configure Coturn for TURN/STUN
   - Set up Janus WebRTC Gateway or FreeSWITCH
   - Configure for UDP traffic/RTP media
   - Optimize network settings for low latency

5. Create Hetzner-specific network configuration:
   - Configure private networks between app and media servers
   - Set up appropriate firewall rules:
     - Allow WebRTC ports (10000-20000 UDP)
     - Allow SIP ports if needed
     - Secure SSH and management access
   - Enable optimized routing between regions if using multiple locations

6. Configure Hatchbox deployment pipeline:
   - Set up continuous deployment from main branch
   - Configure environment variables in Hatchbox dashboard
   - Set up proper database migration handling
   - Configure SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt integration)

7. Implement monitoring specific to Hetzner:
   - Configure Hetzner Cloud monitoring alerts
   - Set up server metrics collection
   - Configure log aggregation
   - Create Grafana dashboards for WebRTC metrics

8. Create backup and disaster recovery procedures:
   - Configure automated database backups to Hetzner Storage Box
   - Set up log archiving
   - Document recovery procedures specific to Hetzner/Hatchbox
   - Create scripts for environment recreation if needed

This deployment configuration leverages Hetzner's cost-effective infrastructure with Hatchbox's simplified Rails deployment platform, providing a robust foundation for Papercup's WebRTC calling service.
