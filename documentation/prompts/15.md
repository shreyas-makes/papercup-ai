Now, let's implement comprehensive testing and optimize the application for performance and reliability.

1. Create end-to-end tests for critical flows:
   - User registration and login
   - Making a call
   - Purchasing credits
   - Viewing call history

2. Implement performance optimization:
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add background processing for heavy tasks

3. Create load testing suite:
   - Simulate concurrent users
   - Test WebRTC capacity
   - Verify database performance under load
   - Monitor memory and CPU usage

4. Implement error tracking and monitoring:
   - Add Sentry for error capturing
   - Set up logging strategy
   - Create alert system for critical issues
   - Add performance monitoringM

5. Optimize frontend performance:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add service worker for offline capabilities
   - Optimize asset loading
   - Implement proper caching strategy

6. Create a comprehensive security test plan:
   - Perform vulnerability scanning
   - Test authentication system security
   - Verify proper authorization checks
   - Test against common web vulnerabilities

7. Implement browser compatibility testing:
   - Test across major browsers
   - Verify WebRTC support
   - Test mobile browser functionality
   - Create fallbacks for unsupported features

8. Develop resilience testing:
   - Test system behavior during outages
   - Verify recovery procedures
   - Test failover mechanisms
   - Validate data consistency after failures

This comprehensive testing and optimization approach ensures the application is robust, secure, and performs well under various conditions.
