Now it's time to connect our frontend components to the real backend API. We'll replace all the mock functionality with actual API calls.

1. Create a real API service to replace the mock one:
   ```javascript
   // app/javascript/services/api.js
   export default {
     // Authentication
     login: async () => {
       // Real login implementation
     },
     
     // Calls
     initiateCall: async (phoneNumber, countryCode) => {
       // Real call initiation
     },
     
     // Credits
     getBalance: async () => {
       // Get real balance
     },
     
     // History
     getCallHistory: async () => {
       // Get real call history
     }
   }
   ```

2. Update the Stimulus controllers to use the real API:
   - Replace mock data loading with API calls
   - Use real authentication flow
   - Connect to actual WebRTC services

3. Implement browser-side WebRTC:
   - Fetch WebRTC tokens from the token endpoint
   - Set up RTCPeerConnection with ICE servers
   - Handle media streams and connection states
   - Connect to Twilio for PSTN calls

4. Add real-time updates with ActionCable:
   - Subscribe to CallChannel for updates
   - Receive and handle call state changes
   - Update UI based on server events

5. Connect payment flow to Stripe:
   - Implement Stripe Checkout integration
   - Handle successful payment redirects
   - Update credit balance display after purchase

6. Implement proper error handling:
   - Handle API failures gracefully
   - Show appropriate error messages
   - Retry logic for transient failures

7. Add loading states for all API operations:
   - Show spinners during API calls
   - Disable buttons during processing
   - Indicate progress for long operations

8. Implement proper logout and session handling:
   - Clear local state on logout
   - Handle session expiration
   - Prompt re-authentication when needed

Test the complete flow from authentication through making calls and purchasing credits. Ensure all components interact correctly with the real backend and that error cases are handled appropriately.
