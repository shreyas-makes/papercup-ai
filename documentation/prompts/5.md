Now, let's build the active call screen overlay that appears when a call is in progress. This will be shown over the dialer when a call is active.

1. Create a Stimulus controller for the active call screen:
   - Implement a timer that counts up from 0:00
   - Add mock functionality for the end call button
   - Create simulated call states (connecting, active, ended)

2. Build the call screen UI:
   - Fixed position overlay covering the dialer area
   - White background with subtle shadow
   - Width matching dialer (320px)
   - Padding: 24px
   - Fade-in animation (200ms ease-in)

3. Implement call information elements:
   - Number display: 24px, 600 weight
   - Duration timer: 32px, 700 weight
   - Credit balance indicator: 14px, 400 weight
   - Call status indicator with pulsing animation

4. Create the end call button:
   - Red circular button (#FF4444)
   - 64px diameter with white phone icon
   - Shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(255, 68, 68, 0.25)
   - Hover state: Darker red (#E60000)

5. Add mock transitions between call states:
   - Connecting state (show for 2-3 seconds)
   - Connected state (timer starts)
   - Ended state (summary shown briefly)

For testing purposes, add a button that toggles the call screen to simulate starting a call. The call screen should completely replace the dialer when active, and return to the dialer when the call ends.
