# Admin Panel Implementation

Let's implement the admin panel functionality for Papercup using the Speedrail boilerplate's built-in admin capabilities. This will create a robust management interface for monitoring calls, managing users, and handling system operations.

1. Configure the core admin panel:
   - Run the Speedrail admin generator: `rails g speedrail:admin:install`
   - Set up admin-specific authentication using Devise
   - Create admin user model with appropriate role definitions
   - Customize the admin layout with Papercup branding:
     - Apply the color scheme (#000000, #FFFFFF, #FFD700, #4CAF50, #FF4444)
     - Add the Papercup logo to the sidebar

2. Build the Users admin resource:
   - Create admin controller for users: `rails g speedrail:admin:resource User`
   - Configure table columns (email, credit balance, call count, sign-up date)
   - Implement filters for user status and balance ranges
   - Add custom actions:
     - "Add Credits" action with amount input
     - "Suspend User" toggle
     - "Reset Password" function
   - Create a detailed user dashboard showing call history and credit transactions

3. Implement the Calls admin resource:
   - Generate admin controller for calls: `rails g speedrail:admin:resource Call`
   - Set up table with comprehensive call details:
     - User information
     - Phone number
     - Call duration
     - Status
     - Cost
     - Quality metrics
   - Add filters for date ranges and call status
   - Create custom actions:
     - "Refund Call" function
     - "View Call Events" popup
   - Implement a call quality metrics visualization

4. Create the Call Rates admin page:
   - Generate admin resource: `rails g speedrail:admin:resource CallRate`
   - Build bulk import/export functionality for rate sheets
   - Create rate editor with validation for overlapping prefixes
   - Add country code search and filtering
   - Implement rate comparison visualization

5. Build the Credit Transactions admin:
   - Generate admin resource: `rails g speedrail:admin:resource CreditTransaction`
   - Configure columns showing transaction details, users, and amounts
   - Add filters by transaction type and date
   - Implement manual credit adjustment functionality
   - Create transaction export for accounting

6. Develop a custom admin dashboard:
   - Generate a custom dashboard page: `rails g speedrail:admin:page Dashboard`
   - Add key metrics cards:
     - Daily active users
     - Call volume
     - Revenue
     - System health
   - Implement real-time charts for call activity
   - Create quick action buttons for common tasks

7. Add operational admin tools:
   - Create a rate import tool with CSV template
   - Build a call testing interface for staff
   - Implement WebRTC diagnostics page
   - Add system status monitoring dashboard

8. Implement admin API extensions:
   - Create secure, admin-only API endpoints
   - Add admin notification system for alerts
   - Implement scheduled reporting
   - Build audit logging for admin actions

Make sure all admin interfaces follow proper authorization rules so that different admin roles (super admin, call operations, finance, support) have appropriate access levels. Implement comprehensive validation and clear error messages throughout the admin interface.

The admin panel should be fully responsive and support both desktop and mobile admin users. Add comprehensive documentation for each admin feature to help onboard new staff members.
