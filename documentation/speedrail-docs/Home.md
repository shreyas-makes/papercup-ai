### Context

**[Speedrail](https://github.com/ryanckulp/speedrail)** is a simple but massively time-saving template for building MVPs quickly in Ruby on Rails. i (Ryan, maintainer) have deployed and sold multiple apps with 10s of thousands in MRR using Speedrail source code.

the purpose of these docs is not only to articulate Speedrail's opinionated features, but to help users learn Rails generally. these docs are best consumed after taking my [Fundamentals](https://founderhacker.com/fundamentals) and [24 Hour MVP](https://founderhacker.com/24-hour-mvp) courses.

### What to Expect

a few example queries these docs will help answer:

* how do i move the navigation bar to the left side instead of the top?
* what's the best way to support multiple pricing plans and discount codes?
* how do Rails secrets work, and how do i use them between environments?
* what is Turbo/Hotwire and how do i use it?
* where do i configure A/B tests?
* how does RSpec work?
* what is Stimulus JS?

### How to Navigate

1. while coding, skim the Wiki page titles for help.
2. if you can't find what you need, [start a discussion](https://github.com/ryanckulp/speedrail-docs/discussions)
3. discussions (paying users) and [Issues](https://github.com/ryanckulp/speedrail/issues) (paid + free users) will be converted into new guides and code improvements
